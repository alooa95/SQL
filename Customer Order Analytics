/*# EXPLANATION #1 
# "Why do we use SUM(quantity*price) instead of SUM(quantity)*price?"
# In this question, we are using GROUP BY product. 
# The price of each individual product doesn't change. 
# That's why SUM(quantity*price) and SUM(quantity)*price, in this specific question, both give the same results. */

select sum(quantity),
price,
sum(quantity)*price as revenue,
sum(quantity*price) as revenue2,
product 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product;

/*# EXPLANATION #2
# "Why can't I just use sum(price) instead of sum(quantity*price)?"
# In this case, there's no difference between sum(price) and sum(quantity*price).
# However, the correct answer is sum(quantity*price), because revenue is calculated by multiplying the price of the product by the number sold. 
# In this data, each product is sold for only one price, so you can get the same answer with sum(price). 
# But not every dataset will be that simple, and it's best not to assume that's the case.
# If the product was sold for different prices on different days, sum(price) wouldn't give the correct answer. */
